My name is Michael Freim√ºller. I am a philosophy undergraduate student at the University of Vienna.

My primary research areas are ethics, media ethics, technology ethics and meta-ethics.

Before studying philosophy, I worked as a software engineer for 5 years. The experience I gained during this time provides me with a
unique viewpoint that allows me to grasp philosophical problems from a technicians point of view and conversely to look at problems
with technology from a philosophical point of view.
