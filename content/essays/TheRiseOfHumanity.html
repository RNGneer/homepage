<p>In this essay I will argue that the fall of man is not the myth of a
great tragedy but of the greatest gift bestowed to humans: freedom. I
will begin by briefly recounting the myth of the fall of man, as it is
told in the book Genesis of the bible. I will then reject the common
interpretation that the snake was wrong in telling Eve the truth.
Instead I will argue that only due to the snake could Adam and Eve gain
their freedom and that it was indeed God’s will that Adam and Eve should
be free.</p>
<p>Before I recount the myth of the fall of man, I want to stress that I
am not a theologian, but a philosopher. In the fall of man I see
primarily not a religious recounting, but a myth that may or may not be
older than Judaism and Christianity. Same as the myth of the Odyssey
gives us insights into human nature, so does the myth of the fall of
man. Furthermore, because I primarily consider the fall of man to be a
myth, and only secondarily a religious recounting, I can prevent a
deeper discussion about the problem of theodicy. For sake of simplicity
I will assume that God is a good and just being.</p>
<h2 id="the-myth-of-the-fall-of-man">The myth of the fall of man</h2>
<p>The myth of the fall of man is, in the western world, somewhat common
knowledge. Still I will recount it here, to remind those of us who never
heard of it, or forgot about it. In the book Genesis of the bible it is
told about the great tragedy of humanity, the fall of man. Before the
fall, Adam and Eve lived in the Garden of Eden, a place filled with
abundance. God allowed Adam and Eve to eat from all trees in the garden
safe on: the tree of knowledge of good and evil. For if they ate from
the tree, they would die <span class="citation"
data-cites="bibel">(<em>Die Bibel: Einheitsübersetzung Altes Und Neues
Testament</em> 2016, Gen 2:16-17)</span>. At first, Adam and Eve obeyed
God’s rule. It was the snake, a creature “more cunning than all other
animals of the field” (Gen 3:1), that told Eve that God lied to them and
instead of dying, they would “become like God and know about good and
evil” (Gen 3:5). Adam and Eve ate from the tree and realized “that they
were naked” (Gen 3:7). When God learned about their sin, he expelled
them from the Garden of Eden and thereby condemned them to a mortal life
of suffering (Gen 3:23).</p>
<p>In this essay, I will refer to the Garden of Eden as “the garden” and
the tree of knowledge of good and evil as “the tree”.</p>
<p>The fall of man is considered a great tragedy, because it was the
original sin, the first sin committed by humans, which from then on
stained all human beings. Ecclesiasticus said that “sin began with a
woman, and we must all die because of her” (Sir 25:24), while in the
Wisdom of Solomon it is written that “God created man for incorruption
[…] but death entered the world by the envy of the devil” (Weish
2:23–24). If humans before the fall were without sin, but due to the
fall became sinners, then the fall of man was the greatest tragedy of
them all. In other words: <em>that the snake persuaded Eve to eat from
the tree was bad, because it expelled them from the garden</em>. I will
refer to this as the “common interpretation”.</p>
<p>I will subsequently argue that the common interpretation is wrong in
seeing Adam and Eve’s expelling from the garden as bad. Instead I will
argue that the snake did good in telling Eve about the true consequences
that the eating fruits of the tree would result in. Ultimately I will
argue that, because God is good and just, he must have foreseen this
outcome and that by placing the tree and the cunning snake together in
the garden, he must have intended Adam and Eve to be free.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-deed-of-the-snake">The good deed of the snake</h2>
<p>In following the common interpretation, the snake must be seen as the
great deceiver. It is she alone that told Eve about the truth and,
because Adam and Eve got expelled from the garden and all humans became
mortal, she did a great wrong. If we follow the modern notion brought
forward by transhumanists and posthumanists alike, mortality is a great
evil. If the snake didn’t persuade Eve, we would still live forever, in
a place of abundance. We wouldn’t have to work for a living and could
enjoy every moment. It seems clear, therefore, that the common
interpretation is right in calling the snakes’ actions bad.</p>
<p>I will now argue that the snake’s actions were good, because to know
why to follow a rule is better than blindly following it. Remember that
God allowed them to eat the fruits of all trees of the garden, safe
those from the tree. Adam and Eve had to obey one rule, which God
explained to them thus: if they ate from the tree, they would die.
Technically speaking, God told the truth. When they did eat from the
tree, God expelled them from the garden and condemned them to mortality.
But was God right in hiding his true reason?</p>
<p>Imagine dating a person that tells you that they can’t invite you
back to their place, because if they did, you two would break up. The
break up, figuratively speaking, is the death that God warned Adam and
Eve of. Now consider that the true reason your date had you obey to this
rule, was because they already had a partner and kids at home and you
coming back to their place would result in a rather awkward situation
that would lead to a break up. Technically speaking, your date was right
in the described consequences. But was it right of your date to hide the
truth from you? Would you have acted differently if you knew that your
date already had a family at home? If you didn’t know the real reason,
but followed the rule anyway, would you say that you acted freely? This
might sound like a strange question. After all you did act freely in
obeying the rule, because you could have, even without knowing the
rule’s true reason, decide to break the rule. Yet there seems to me to
be a difference in intentionally following and intentionally breaking a
rule. I can break a rule I don’t understand and still be called “acting
freely”. But can the same be said when I follow a rule I don’t
understand? Am I not acting “in accordance to the rule”? Doesn’t the
fact that I follow the rule, without knowing about the true reason, make
me a puppet, figuratively speaking? Would we consider a computer that
follows fixed instructions free? Mustn’t there be more to it than
following orders, to be considered free? Something like “know why” we
have to act in a particular way? Knowing <em>why</em> I have to follow
that rule? If you knew that your date was (questionably - considering
that she is your date) happily married, would you have acted the same
way? The same goes for Adam and Eve. We could imagine that they, had
they known what eating the fruits of the tree would do have resulted in,
would have refrained from eating the fruits. But because they lacked
knowledge about why to follow the rule, they weren’t free in following
it. Instead they were forced to rely on God’s better judgment. Because
the knowledge would have given them the ability to decide, freely and
for themselves, whether or not to eat the fruits. Due to this it can be
said that they would have enjoyed greater freedom. And because having
more freedom is better than having less freedom, enjoying greater
freedom is a good thing. Because it is a good thing, it seems that the
fact that the snake persuaded Eve to eat from the tree, <em>by letting
her know about the consequences of eating the fruits</em>, is a good
thing. Therefore the common interpretation seems to be wrong in saying
that the snake’s telling Eve was wrong.</p>
<p>If the snake did good in persuading Eve to eat from the tree, it must
follow that the fall of man wasn’t a bad thing after all. Still, one
could argue that God didn’t intend to mislead Adam and Eve. Instead it
seems plausible that he realized that telling them the truth about the
fruits of the tree would tempt them even more to eat them. Therefore he
invented a “white lie”, same as parents do with their children when
asked difficult questions like the origins of Santa Claus or the
Christkind, or where babies come from.</p>
<h2 id="lies-love-and-freedom">Lies, Love and Freedom</h2>
<p>I will now present an argument that proves that “white lies”, even
when told with good intentions, are bad, because they can limit a
persons’ freedom. Imagine a teenage girl that recently got her first
boyfriend<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Her mother, realizing the dangers
involved in this delicate matter, decides to give her daughter “the
talk”. We imagine, for sake of simplicity, that her daughter didn’t
already gain more than enough information about sex through the
internet, school and peers. Because her mother is afraid of her daughter
becoming pregnant or getting infected with sexual transmitted diseases,
she is also afraid of telling her daughter the truth about sexual
intercourse. Telling her about sexual intercourse, she fears, would make
her daughter even more curious to try it out. Therefore she invents a
“white lie” and tells her daughter that when cuddling naked with her new
boyfriend, not to make navel-on-navel contact, because that is how
babies are made. Curiously the mother is quite inventive and calls this
“navel-on-navel-course”. Her hope is that, when her daughter and her new
boyfriend find themselves in this situation, her daughter assumes the
touching of their navels to be significant and is at worst most curious
how it feels like and gives no second thought to their genitals. Would
we say that the mother acted rightly? Would we say that the
no-navel-on-navel-course rule is a good rule? After all, we could say
that by inventing this rule, she deflects the attention of her curious
teenage daughter to some harmless experience. If we assumed her daughter
most innocent and obedient, we can assume that she would from then on
try to prevent navel-on-navel-course. Because she tries not to get naked
together with her boyfriend and having their navels touch, she isn’t in
danger of accidentally learning the truth. Because it seems plausible
that, assuming that navel-on-navel-course in happening, it is only a
small step to the “real thing”. Therefore the concerned mothers’ rule
seems good, although it is a lie. Similarly we can imagine God in the
myth of the fall of man to try to prevent Adam and Eve from getting
expelled from the garden by scaring them away from the tree. But I think
that it is not a good rule, because good rules are followed by one’s own
free will, whereas to follow a rule for a different reason than it was
intended to be followed for, is insincere and therefore bad.</p>
<p>It seems indisputable that being chained to a wall, with no ability
to move away, is a bad thing. No one wants to lack their freedom and
being chained to a wall is one sure way to loose one’s freedom. From the
various attempts of prison breaks in the past we can see that people,
once they lost their freedom, try to regain it. Freedom, it seems, is a
good thing that we desire most above all else, while being unfree is
bad.</p>
<p>But what freedom are we talking about in the case of the concerned
mother, and analogously God? Freedom comes in different shapes and
sizes. There is what I will call <em>physical, bodily or outer
freedom</em>. It is the most direct and simplest form of freedom,
because it boils down to an either-or question: Either you are bodily
free or you are not. Either someone locks you into their basement with
no possibility of leaving it, or you are not locked away. Either someone
decided to make you their slave and forces you to obey their orders, or
nobody does so. Another form of freedom is <em>psychological or inner
freedom</em>. This freedom is more complex, because it comes in various
degrees. Societal norms and rules all restrict inner freedom. To not
punch someone, whose face is particularly displeasing to you, on the
nose, is a indisputably good norm that limits your freedom. Sometimes we
all have bad days and besides feeling (and looking) like crap, it would
be most unfortunate if we got repeatedly punched for it, too. What is
difficult about inner freedom is that, while it concerns your behavior
and your thinking, in many cases it originates from the outside. From a
young age we are told to be kind to others, not to fight, not to lie
etc. These rules slowly become a part of our thinking and limit our
inner freedom by making the possible impossible. If you grow up thinking
that life’s goal is to make as much money as possible and to spend as
much time on your job as possible, the idea that this might not be such
a smart idea after all will not, on its own, cross your mind. To think
this thought has become not only an impossibility, but the impossibility
of an impossibility, because if it were a mere impossibility, it were
still possible to reach the conclusion that there are more important
things than making money. You could simply play around with your
thoughts until you reached their negation. Instead, there is a hole
without the trace of a hole, where this thought would have resided in,
had it been thinkable. Inner freedom, therefore, is a different beast
from bodily freedom. While for you to loose your bodily freedom requires
someone else forcefully take it from you, no one can take away your
inner freedom, because only you can remove the possibility of the
possible. As long as you believe in the possibility of an idea, it will
continue to exist. As soon as you renounce this thought, the possible
will become the impossible impossibility.</p>
<p>It is without a doubt that to brainwash someone, and thereby limiting
their inner freedom, is a bad thing. To be free means, simply put,
to-be-able-to: to be able to move, to say something, to think a thought.
To be unfree, conversely, means the opposite. No one, I most boldly
assume, wants to loose their outer freedom. For most of us, force is
necessary to wrestle it from us. Yet, when we are loosing our inner
freedom, we don’t fight or struggle against it. I think that, because
only we ourselves can limit our inner freedom, the restriction doesn’t
seem as bad as our loss of physical freedom. Seneca reminds us how often
we freely give up our freedom, without giving a second thought about it.
While people refuse to give up their homes and are always ready to take
up arms to defend them against intruders, they are more than willing to
put their lives in the service of others <span class="citation"
data-cites="seneca">(Seneca 2010, 122–23)</span>. “There is nobody”, he
writes, “that wants to give away his money; his own life, on the other
hand, to oh how many people everybody is giving it away to!”<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (p. 123). It is curious that we find
it so easy to trade in our inner freedom. Is it because we cannot track
it, that it looses its value? It seems similar to cashless payments,
which make us loose the sense of the money we are giving away. As long
as we hold it in our hands, it exists for us. But as soon as it becomes
a number on a screen, its reality, and therefore its value, vanishes.
The volatile nature of our inner freedom should make us even more
careful to protect it. But the opposite seems to be the case.</p>
<p>While it is unarguably bad to loose one’s bodily freedom, it is even
worse to loose our inner freedom, because by loosing it we give up not
only the impossibility to think a thought, but the impossibility of its
impossibility. Thought itself becomes unthinkable. It vanishes without a
trace. To regain your physical freedom, you have to break the chains
that hold you down. But to regain your inner freedom? This means not
only to break through your inner chains, but to rediscover that which
you have lost. It means to think that which has become impossible for
you to think.</p>
<p>If loosing one’s physical freedom is bad, I think it is safe to say
that loosing one’s inner freedom is even worse. We can imagine a future
prison, where felons are no longer locked away behind bars, but instead
receive brain implants that change their behavior. Instead of physically
limiting their freedom, these chips respond to “criminal” thought
patterns and prevent them from happening. Crime, thus, becomes
impossible for the criminals. It becomes impossible in a twofold way:
physically, because they can no longer act on it, and psychologically,
because the idea of crime becomes impossible to think - an impossible
impossibility. Although I can imagine the apologetics of technological
progress to praise this future, I think that this is an even worse
punishment than physical prisons. To alter a person’s behavior by
altering their thinking and thus limiting their inner freedom, is way
worse, because, in the case of the chip, it might become irreversible.
One might argue that in the case of criminals this is not a bad thing,
because their “unchecked” behavior threatens the whole society. But
where do we draw the line? Talking about molesters and murderers is one
thing. But what about a tyrannic government that decides that outlaw any
notion of democracy? If to think about democracy becomes a crime, than
they could decide to implant a chip preventing the idea of democracy
from popping up in our heads into every citizen. Indisputably this would
be bad. It is bad because it is not merely a limitation, but the
annihilation of thought itself. Thus we must assume that inner freedom
takes precedence over bodily freedom, although bodily freedom is
necessary in the first place to establish inner freedom - a thesis that
space does not permit me to expand on here.</p>
<p>When the concerned mother tells her daughter to refrain from
navel-on-navel-course, she limits her daughters’ inner freedom. She
doesn’t simply put a physical lock on her daughter, instead she forms
her daughter’s thinking by removing the possibility of the idea of
sexual intercourse and instead introducing the idea of
navel-on-navel-course. When her daughter, being an obedient child,
follows her mothers rule, she does so not out of a free will. To her
thinking, she understands the rule and thus wants to be a good girl and
not come near the forbidden navel of her boyfriend. In reality she obeys
to her mother’s “white lie”, and being deceived by it, she acts for
reasons that are not her own. If her mother were to tell her about
sexual intercourse instead, she could make up her mind and find her own
stance on the problem. She might realize the dangers involved in getting
pregnant at her age, or decide that STD’s are not worth the hassle.
Instead her thinking is imprisoned by following her mother’s “white
lie”. We could argue that we can forgive the mother’s “white lie”,
because she had her daughter’s best interests in mind. Or did she?
Because if she had her best interests in mind, the mother would surely
have realized that freedom stands on top of that list. There might be
danger in freedom, but an act done out of a free will is better than an
act done out of restricted knowledge. Had God told Adam and Eve about
the consequences of eating from the tree, they would have been able to
consider them and the words of the snake would have lost their appeal.
Instead God opted for a “white lie” and thus became a tyrant of their
minds by annihilating thought. When the snake told Eve the truth, she
not only stated a fact, but also freed both Eve and Adam from their
mental prison. She gave them freedom to act freely and not out of God’s
will.</p>
<p>If we return to the objection of this section, that it was wrong of
the snake to tell Eve the truth and thus get Adam and Eve expelled from
a place of abundance and immortality, we have to consider the worth of
freedom against the things Adam and Eve would have enjoyed in the
garden. Is abundance better than freedom? Is the life of an immortal
slave better than the life of a mortal, but free, human being? I think
that freedom takes precedence over everything else. What good would it
be to be immortal but lack freedom? It would be a miserable, never
ending, existence. All the abundance of the world couldn’t make up for
it. Only pure hedonists would opt for a world filled with abundance that
lacks freedom. I don’t think that we should think this option viable. It
is better to be free and experience lack, than it is to experience the
opposite. Realizing that you lack something is better than lacking
something and not even realizing that you do so. Therefore the snake did
Adam and Eve a great deed by giving them inner freedom. She did not
condemn them to lives of mortal misery, but instead gifted them with
freedom.</p>
<h2 id="gods-foresight">God’s foresight</h2>
<p>There is but one question that needs to be asked now: If God is
almighty, good, just and wise, how was it possible that he placed the
tree and the cunning snake in one and the same place? Could he not build
a giant electric fence around the tree? God being god and Adam and Eve
being oblivious to electricity, this would have surely prevent them from
coming near the tree. Or was it too much to ask to place the snake in an
unreachable pit or expel it from the garden in the first place? Did he
not foresee what would happen?</p>
<p>I think that the claim that God is almighty does not conflict with
his decision to place the tree and the cunning snake in one and the same
place. Instead I will argue that it was God’s plan all along to have
both in place so that Adam and Eve could gain their <em>original
freedom</em>. Thus I will directly oppose the christian notion of
original sin.</p>
<p>Although I said in the beginning that I would not talk about the
problem of theodicy, I will still place my toe in its most shallow
water. According to the common interpretation, God told Adam and Eve
that eating from the tree would cause them to die. This, as I argued
above, was a lie. A “white lie”, but a lie none the less. It might be
better than telling them a blatant, one could argue, but it would still
not be the whole truth. If someone tells not the whole truth, but only a
part of it, he tells partly a lie. Therefore, God lied to Adam and Eve,
albeit only partly.</p>
<p>But given that God is almighty, just, good and wise, how can it be
that he told Adam and Eve partly a lie? Even more, by telling precisely
this lie, he placed a rule on Adam and Eve that restricted their inner
freedom by limiting their thinking. He created a false truth in their
heads that, from then on, guided their thinking. But how is it possible
that God did that? Would this not imply that God is not good, because
telling a lie and thus restricting someone’s inner freedom is bad? Or
did he not foresee what would happen, which would make him anything but
almighty? Can we accept this conclusion and instead think of God as not
almighty, not good etc.?</p>
<p>Having argued that Adam and Eve gained freedom by learning about the
truth, I think that we should dismiss the idea that God is anything by
almighty, good etc. Instead we have to conclude that he was aware of
what would happen, when he placed the tree together with the cunning
snake in the garden. He must have been aware that telling when Adam and
Eve the truth, they would not have been tempted by the snake to eat the
forbidden fruit, for they would have realized that being expelled from
the garden wasn’t worth the hassle. Instead he set it up in a way that
allowed for Adam and Eve to “accidentally” stumble upon the truth and
thus gain their original freedom. One might ask at that point, why God
didn’t gift them with freedom in the first place. Why did he place them
in the garden first and expelled them when they gained their original
freedom? I think that, given that I consider the mythological aspect of
the fall of man, it should signify that humans weren’t born with
freedom, but instead had to gain it. If humans were born with freedom,
it would be impossible to take it from them. But there is nothing that
stops someone from throwing newborns directly into prison. Same as there
is nothing that prevents someone from brainwashing entire generations
and thus severely limiting their freedom. Freedom is an achievement of
humanity, which is why I think that the title “the fall of man” is badly
chosen. It was not a great sin that the snake told Eve and that Eve
“persuaded” Adam. Instead it was its greatest deed, because it helped
Adam and Eve gain their freedom. Thus, instead of “the fall of man”, I
propose to call it “the rise of man”.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this essay I argued that the myth of “the fall of man”, as told in
the bible, is in truth a myth of freedom. I argued that what the snake
did in telling Eve the truth, was not a great tragedy to humanity, but a
great deed. It helped them gain their “original freedom”, which I see as
directly opposing the notion of original sin. Then I argued that God,
being almighty, good, just and wise, was aware of what would happen and
thus refrained from keeping Adam and Eve away from the tree. This myth,
I finally argue, signifies that freedom is not something humans are born
with, but has to be won.</p>
